Manhattan Core Replacement
Uber added 3.82 million pickups in Manhattan (south of 110th St/96th St) between 2014–2015, while taxis lost 3.83 million. Net change: -12,442 rides, showing Uber directly replaced taxis.

Outer Borough Growth
In Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, Uber and taxis grew. Example: Uber added 1.1M pickups in Brooklyn, while taxis gained 299k. Suggests Uber filled gaps in subway-deficient areas (e.g., Dyker Heights).

Evening Congestion
Uber added 682 more pickups/hour in Manhattan’s core during 4–5 PM (2015 vs. 2014), overlapping with taxi shift changes. Data lacks dropoff locations, so traffic impact is debated.

Market Share Shifts
Uber’s citywide pickup share rose from 4% (2014) to 15% (2015). Taxis retained dominance north of 59th St (25% vs. Uber’s 15%).

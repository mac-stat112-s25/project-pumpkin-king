Pumpkin King

Alena Han, Leah Zhang

We want to look at a dataset from The Great Pumpkin Commonwealth’s (GPC) competition held in 2021, which includes numerous variables like id, weight, and ranking. 
We want to explore the average weight of pumpkins in this competition and the top ten weight of pumpkins. In addition, we will also find out whether the weight of pumpkins varied with regions/ countries. 


Reasons: First, the theme of this dataset is interesting and attractive. How big is the biggest pumpkin? More importantly, there are enough observations but not too many, so we can later deal with the dataset (clean and visualize) easily. These observations and data also supports us to do a range of visualizations, eg, spatial map, bar plot, histogram,etc.

We want to explore the average weight of pumpkins in this competition and the top ten weight of pumpkins. In addition, we will also find out whether the weight of pumpkins varied with regions/ countries.\nReasons: First, the theme of this dataset is interesting and attractive. How big is the biggest pumpkin? More importantly, there are enough observations but not too many, so we can later deal with the dataset (clean and visualize) easily. These observations and data also supports us to do a range of visualizations, eg, spatial map, bar plot, histogram,etc.\n\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n# 第一张表格\nplan1 &lt;- tibble(\n  Tasks = c(\"Case study\", \"Identify variables of interest/ Develop research question(s)\", \"Outline\", \"Clean data\",\"Data wrangling – compute metrics\", \"Visualization – top 10 bar plot\", \"Visualization – region map\", \"Final outline/report\"),\n  Name = c(\"Leah and Alena\", \"Both\", \"Both\", \"Alena\",\"Leah\", \"Alena\", \"Leah\", \"Both\"),\n  Description = c(\"Learn NYC Uber case and make a conclusion\",\n                  \"List and understand variables from the dataset and decide what to explore\",\n                  \"Write up things we will do and the project structure\",\n                  \"Combine tables and select the useful column.

Net change: -12,442 rides, showing Uber directly replaced taxis.\nOuter Borough Growth In Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, Uber and taxis grew. Example: Uber added 1.1M pickups in Brooklyn, while taxis gained 299k. Suggests Uber filled gaps in subway-deficient areas (e.g., Dyker Heights).\nEvening Congestion Uber added 682 more pickups/hour in Manhattan’s core during 4–5 PM (2015 vs. 2014), overlapping with taxi shift changes. Data lacks dropoff locations, so traffic impact is debated.\nMarket Share Shifts Uber’s citywide pickup share rose from 4% (2014) to 15% (2015). Taxis retained dominance north of 59th St (25% vs. Uber’s 15%).",
